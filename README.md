## Overview

This project starts as a tool for me and my friends make 3d figures of our characters and monsters in a RPG game.

## Requirements

It's good to have GCC to run the quick start step, or you could just run other C compiler.

## Quick start

You can download/clone this project. After doing that, open a Terminal/CMD and run

```
gcc main.c -o <your_output_binary> | your_output_binary ./path_to_your_file
```

## Status

Under development.
